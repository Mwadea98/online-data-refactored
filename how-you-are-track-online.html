					<h1 class="mt-5 title">How you are exposed and how to protect yourself online</h1>
					<p class="mt-3">
						Client, customer, and employee personal information in your possession can be subject to a data breach in a myriad of ways. E-mail addresses, banking, passwords, physical addresses, phone numbers and more can inadvertently find their ways to scammers, hackers, undesired marketers, and more. Most compliance and legal area employees have little idea how to go implement data protection from internet threats. What to do?
						<br><br>
						Here are five of the most significant online threats to data privacy coming from the web and best practices to handle them:

								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title mb-3">Unsafe web browsing practices</h4>
									<p>
										Many users don't scrutinize sites on which they find information. There are often signs that sites you visit can be malicious and ask for your PI: free offers, shortened URLs, pages socially engineered to trick users to set up an account and download malware from them.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title mb-3">What you can do</h4>
									<ul>
										<li>Keep your anti-virus up to date</li>
										<li>Use the most secure Internet browser -- Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge</li>
										<li>Scan files with your anti-virus software before downloading</li>
										<li>Don’t re-use passwords for multiple websites</li>
										<li>Turn on your browser's pop up blocker.</li>
									</ul>

								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">Cookies and web tracking</h4>
									<p class="mt-3">
										Cookies are files downloaded to your browser by a website that contain unique identifier data about the site. However, they don’t contain any personal information or software code. When a website "sees" the data it set in a cookie, it knows the browser is one that has contacted it before.
										<br><br>
										They can be useful for things like keeping your login information for a site so you don’t have to enter it again. Cookies can also be used to track your activities and capture your purchasing habits and then be shared with unwanted third parties affiliated with the site.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">What you can do</h4>
									<ul class="mt-3">
										<li>Set your browser to delete cookies every time you finish browsing</li>
										<li>Set "opt out" cookies on your browser to cookies aren't allowed at all in your browser.</li>
									</ul>

					<div class="card mt-5">

							<div class="row mt-5">
								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">IP address tracking</h4>
									
									<p class="mt-3">
										The COPPA Act specifically states that IP addresses are personal information since they are information about an identifiable individual associated with them. An Internet Protocol (IP) address is a numerical label behind the familiar web addresses we see every day. It identifies a device over the internet. Hacker often come through IP addresses as their first point of attack.
										Undesirable parties may trace your PI by looking up your website address if it is listed in WHOIS, the central database containing all web addresses on the internet. Ownership information is readily available here.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">What you can do</h4>
									<ul class="mt-3">
										<li>
											If you set up a website, you can request a private WHOIS listing from the database manager, Network Solutions. Their name, address and other ownership information will appear instead of yours.
										</li>
										<li>
											When working on your personal computer, you can use a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tool.
										</li>
										<li>
											Employees or clients at home have “leased” IP addresses with their cable modem and ISP accounts. Your IP won’t change until you turn off your modem. Power it down as often as you feel the need.
										</li>
									</ul>

								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">Using HTTP Instead of HTTPS Encrypted Web Server Connections</h4>
									<p class="mt-3">
										Personal data flowing between a user's machine and a website using plain HTTP protocol can be monitored by other companies or potentially intercepted and stolen by malicious hackers (often called the "man-in-the-middle"). That’s where Secure Sockets Layer(SSL) comes in.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">What you can do</h4>
									<p class="mt-3">
										HTTPS or Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encrypts information sent between a website and a user's machine. When purchasing or entering personal information on websites, always check for an “https://” or a padlock icon in your browser’s URL bar to verify that a site is secure before entering any personal information. When you see HTTPS instead of HTTP in your browser's address bar, you'll know it is a secure site!
										<br><br>
										If you're hosting a website, consider implementing SSL on your web server to ensure data privacy between you and customers. It will also help mitigate direct hacking threats. You will need to find a digital certificate authority (CA) such as Verisign to help set it up.

									<h4 class="title">The threat from the cloud</h4>
									<p class="mt-3">
										Cloud computing is the latest and greatest technological wave that brings up new issues for data privacy. This is especially true when you give up administrative and technological controls to an outside party. That in of itself is a major threat.
										A cloud provider may be deficient in backup processes, security practices, employee controls, application interfaces & APIs to name just a few. Plus, you never know who has the "keys of the kingdom" to view all your data in there. Scary.
									</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-lg-6">
									<h4 class="title">What you can do</h4>
									<p class="mt-3">
										Both you and the cloud provider are in charge of security, not just the latter. If you are storing data in cloud storage or using a cloud platform to host a website, there are a few things you want to consider:
										Find out from the provider who is in charge of each cloud security control.
										Train someone in the use of provider-provided identity and access tools so you can control yourself who has access to data and applications.
										Ensure the provider has all your data that is stored with them encrypted
										Major cloud providers all offer logging tools. Use these to enable self-security logging and monitoring to monitor any unauthorized access attempts and other issues.
										A combination of government regulations and responsible individual practices can only thwart potential cyber threats not eliminate them. Your compliance & legal area can do its part by implementing comprehensive threat analysis and response measures.

						In this project, I have learned about how data is collected online, how it can be used and what measures we can take to remain anonymous online. I learned how companies using surveillance capitalism can use our private data. We must try to remain anonymous and used techniques to protect our data as much as possible.
