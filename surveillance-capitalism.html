							<h2 class="title">The Age of Surveillance Capitalism</h2>
							<p class="mt-3">
								Surveillance capitalism claims human experience as raw material for translation into behavioral data. That data is partially used to improve the digital products or services; but most importantly it is declared "proprietary behavioral surplus" fed into "machine intelligence" manufacturing processes producing predictions products". These "behavioral prediction products" are sold in a new type of market: the "behavioral futures market".
							</p>
							<p>
								In the battle for market domination and profit maximalization, surveillance capitalists are on an endless quest to acquire ever-more predictive sources of behavioral surplus. This is, according to Zuboff, the first economic imperative of Surveillance capitalism: "the extraction imperative". This imperative means that "raw material supplies
								must be produced at an ever-expanding scale".
							</p>
							<p class="highlight">
								As soon as you go online, multiple parties track everything you are doing. We live in constant surveillance, and your online behavior is used for targeted advertisement. But how did this happen and what are the consequences for our society?

										Who exactly do I mean with “they”. I speak about surveillance capitalists. Companies which offer products and services to extract our behavioral user data and make predictions and modifications to our future behavior.
									</p>
									<p>
										Surveillance capitalists see your behavior data as their proprietary and use the data to feed machine intelligence to fabricate sophisticated prediction products. These prediction products are then traded on behavioral futures market places. The more data is fed into this new machine intelligence-based “means of production,” the more powerful are its prediction products.

									<h6>Economies of scope</h6>
									Economies of scope mean the more varied the data sources are, the higher its predictive value.

					<h4>Google and the birth of surveillance capitalism</h4>
					<p>
						It is the extraction imperative - and the desire for profit - that explains, for instance, Google's seemingly
						unconnected range of products: from Gmail, over to their search engine, their book projects, their Android
						software or the mapping of the world. What all these things have in common, is that they contribute to and make
						possible: "the extraction of raw material": our voices, our search queries, our mails, our use of their home sensors,
						our gps location, …. They all enable Google to extract "behavioral data’" fabricated into predictive products.
					</p>
					<p>
						Zuboff views Google as the inventor of surveillance capitalism. Surveillance capitalism, she stresses, should not be
						equaled with digital technology. Surveillance capitalism was born digitally, but is no longer confined to borndigital companies. Crucial to the success of surveillance capitalist companies is the dispossession of behavioral
						surplus: raw material supplies should be free and the law should be kept at bay
					</p>
					<h4 class="mt-5">The surveillance market is a hugely profitable market.</h4>
					<p>
						Among surveillance capitalists, the real competition is about finding new "mines" of (free) raw material
						guaranteeing continuous access. The first economic principle of surveillance capitalism – the extraction
						imperative – necessitates economies of scale. Prediction is only as good as (1) the amount of data, (2) the
						computing power and (3) the sophistication of machine learning procedures.
					</p>
					<p>
						This is why Google and other surveillance capitalists embark onto all kinds of - at first sight - completely unrelated
						activities. All Google’s services – I surveyed some earlier – contribute to and collaborate in the revamping of all
						mediated computation into an extraction architecture.
					</p>
					<p>
						It is important to remember that the actual product that these surveillance capitalists are selling is not "your data",
						but "predictional models". Not only data but also machine learning is, thus, crucial to achieve this. In order to be
						able to deal with such huge and rich data, computing power should be huge. And it is again no surprise that
						Google not only has the largest computing network in the world: it also focuses on hiring AI-specialists and on
						developing new technologies like the Tensor processing Chip for "deep learning", in order to enable their machines
						to learn more and faster.
					</p>
					<h4>Summary</h4>
					<p>
						To conclude we can say that companies who follow this emerging kind of capitalism not only monitor and control what you find, see, read and watch to a considerable degree, but also manipulate your behavior according to their economic interests.
					</p>
					<p>
						While surveillance capitalists know everything about us, we know very little about them. The pioneers in this field are already the most valuable publicly traded companies in the world, and now this model of capitalism is adopted by traditional companies too. The technological trend of artificial intelligence will only increase the need for more data and further enhance our dependence on these.
					</p>
					<p>
						We are witnessing an unprecedented amount of surveillance and observe the highest rates of depression of our youngest generation because they think the status quo is reasonable and the attention economy creates platforms, which are designed to be as addictive as possible.
					</p>
					<p class="mb-5">
						The combination of artificial social systems, out-predicting machine intelligence, and extractive incentives downgrade human nature and benefit the richest from the rich.

						<h6>About</h6>
						<p class="text-justify">
							In this project, I have learned about how data is collected online, how it can be used and what measures we can take to remain anonymous online. I learned how companies using surveillance capitalism can use our private data. We must try to remain anonymous and used techniques to protect our data as much as possible.
